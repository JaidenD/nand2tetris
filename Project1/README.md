Code is tested on [nand2tetris Web IDE](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/chip/#accept).

My understanding of the assignment is that I can use previously constructed gates to construct new gates.

I need to make the following starting from `Nand`:

- Not  
- And  
- Or  
- Xor  
- Mux  
- Dmux  
- Not16  
- And16  
- Or16  
- Mux16  
- Or8Way  
- Mux4Way16  
- Mux8Way16  
- DMux4Way  
- DMux8Way
