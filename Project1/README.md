My understanding of the assignment is I can use previously constructed gates to construct new gates.

I need to make the following starting fron Nand:
-     Not
-     And
-     Or
-     Xor
-     Mux
-     Dmux
-     Not16
-     And16
-     Or16
-     Mux16
-     Or8Way
-     Mux4Way16
-     Mux8Way16
-     DMux4Way
-     DMux8Way
